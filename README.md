## 👨‍💻 About Me  
I'm Soham, a programmer focused on **Python & Data Analysis**, currently learning **frontend (HTML & CSS)** as the first step toward full-stack development, and exploring **cybersecurity fundamentals**.  

I believe in learning by **building real projects**, improving step by step, and understanding concepts deeply rather than rushing.  

When I'm not coding, I enjoy **gaming 🎮, anime & manga 📚**, reading books, and admiring **BMWs 🚗**.
